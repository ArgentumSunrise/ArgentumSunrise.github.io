            About Us
        </h1>
        <p>
            Rising Sun is one of America's oldest and most storied airlines. We have more history on board our flights and in our terminals than any other airline, and that history lends us an air of sophistication and industry that really shows in how we operate. Rising Sun Airlines began in 1929, when our founder, Jared Carr, strapped a pair of cardboard wings to his arms and jumped off the roof of his house. Inspired by the experience (as well as the severe brain damage), Jared went to work on his own plane as soon as he left the hospital. His first invention was the four-wing biplane, which is still Rising Sun's standard model today. Over the years, as our company and casualty list blossomed, we built up an international identity, with fleets of airplanes and one of the most 'trusted' brands in the world, with such notable passengers as John F. Kennedy, the Dalai Lama, Elvis Presley, and Michael Jordan. Flying Rising Sun is like standing on the shoulders of giants. And then falling off. Into the ocean.

            <h1>Safety</h1>
            <br>
            <p>To ensure safety aboard our flights, simply follow these simple rules: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>- All attractive women must wear revealing bikinis at all times aboard flights, to ensure maximum cleavage protection.</li>
                <li>- Due to several structural 'bugs,' anyone weighing more than 210 lbs is not permitted to board a Rising Sun flight.</li>
                <li>- Due to material and legal considerations, our planes no longer include chapels. We also ask you to please bring your own crucifixes aboard our flights, as we will no longer be furnishing them.</li>
                <li>- In case of emergency, please do not panic. Statistically, you have a 65% chance of surviving one of our flights, but panic lowers that to 2%.</li>
                </li>- Our flights often layover in the Kabul Afghan Metropolitan Airport (KAX). While there, we advise you to refuse any and all substances offered to you by Muslim-looking strangers. They are likely to be a form of opium, and we really can't deal with any more FDA lawsuits.
                <li>- Please do not bring pets aboard our planes. Our cargo holds are neither heated nor oxygenated, and we're tired of cleaning Chihuahua corpses out of the corners.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Thank you, and have a nice flight.</p>

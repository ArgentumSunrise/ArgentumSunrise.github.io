                <p><i>"Before flying with Rising Sun, I never thought that I'd experience anything like this in my life. Now I experience it every night. In my nightmares. My horrible, horrible nightmares."</i>
                    <br> - Seneca Johnson, Spokane, WA</p>
                <p><i>"I have seen the red light of Hell, and it has very reasonable carry-on prices.<a id='maybe' href='usually.html'>*</a>"</i>
                    <br> - Joel Schraeder, Montpelier, VT</p>
                <p><i>"To be honest, when I first bought a ticket, I was expecting a bad flight. But then, it turned out that I had confused 'Rising Sun Airlines' with the <span id='allahu-akbar'>'Iraqi Rising Sun Islamic Purity Militia.'</span> It was not an experience I'd recommend."</i>
                    <br> - Carmen Tanner, Des Moines, IA</p>
                <p><i>"I was once raped in the anus with a Swiss army knife taped to a 2MW laser. Flying Rising Sun was like that, except more painful."</i>
                    <br> - Jose Ramiras, Brownsville, TX</p>
                <p><i>"The spiders. The spiders. The spiders. The spiders are in my brain. The spiders are in my dreams. The spiders are in my bones. The spiders are everywhere. The spiders are everywhere. There is no everywhere. There is only spiders. <span>There is only spiders.</span>"</i>
                    <br> - Drake Mort, Boise, ID</p>
                <p><i>"I'M IN LOVE WITH THE COCO"</i>
                    <br> - Henry Kaufman, Denver, CO</p>
                <p><i>"私の娘は、その飛行機の1に殺された。ライジングサンのので、私は娘を持っていません。私は彼らに永遠の復讐を誓う。"</i>
                    <br> - Yuki Shinano, Sapporo, Hokkaido Prefecture, Japan</p>
                <p><i>"This is, without a doubt, the worst airline in the world. Their planes are slipshod, badly maintained, and prone to catastrophic failure. Over four-fifths of their pilots are not certified, even at a student level, and they are not recognized by any major corporation. They operate illegally out of Tajikistan. Their CEO tried to poison me with arsenic-laced scotch, and I found a human skull in a wheel well.<br> I beg you - do not, for the love of all that is holy, fly Rising Sun. Please God. Please."</i>
